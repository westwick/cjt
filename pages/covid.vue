          <h1>Captain Jack’s Covid-19 Health and Safety</h1>
          <p class="blog-info">Posted by Captain Jack</p>

          <p>The health and safety of our guests and staff come first at Captain Jack’s Santa Barbara Tours.   We will be implementing procedures to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19.</p>
          <p>Our staff will answer all the health screening questions and have their temperature taken prior to starting any tours.</p>
          <p>Guests will also be asked to complete the health screening prior to beginning a tour.  The health screening includes the following three questions and a temperature check:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have you been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19?</li>
            <li>Are you experiencing shortness of breath, a cough or a sore throat?</li>
            <li>Do you or have you had a fever in the last 72 hours?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you check in, you will be asked to sign a waiver.  The clip board and the writing instruments will be sanitized before and after use.</p>
          <p>Our vehicle interiors will be wiped down and sanitized before and after your tour with special attention being paid to high touch points like door handles, seat belts and power window controls.  Disinfectant wipes will be available to you for personal use during the tour.</p>
          <p>All vehicles will be equipped with hand sanitizer, masks and disposable gloves and available for use.</p>
          <p>Tour guides and guests should wear masks covering nose and mouth while in vehicles and when appropriate.  Please maintain social distancing of at least 6’.</p>
          <p>All kayaking equipment (kayaks, paddles and life jackets) will be sanitized prior to use.</p>
