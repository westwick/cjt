          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <p class="blog-info">Posted by Captain Jack</p>
          <h2>How do I make a reservation?</h2>
          <p>Some tours can be booked online and other bookings over the phone. We are open from 8am - 5pm every day. Please call us at (805) 564-1819 to make your reservation. Payment is due at the time of booking and can be made by visa or mastercard.</p>

          <h2>How far in advance do I need to reserve?</h2>
          <p>If you are planning your tour for a Saturday, which is always our busiest day, we recommend booking 2 - 3 weeks in advance. For any other day of the week, we appreciate 2 - 3 days notice. For large groups it is always best to give us as much advance notice as possible. In some cases we can accommodate same day requests, but we appreciate as much notice as you can give us.</p>

          <p>Some of our group events, such as winery dinners, sailing regattas, or channel islands kayaking, will often require more than 30 days notice. Please call us for details on specific events.</p>

          <h2>Where do the tours start?</h2>
          <p>For all of our wine tours and full day tours we will pick you up from anywhere in Santa Barbara. We normally pick up at hotels but we can also pick you up at a residence. If you are not staying in town, our default meeting place is the Santa Barbara Visitor Center, located at 1 Garden St.</p>

          <p>Some of our tours, such as kayaking or horseback riding, require that you drive to a different location. Please call for details about the specific tour you are interested in.</p>

          <h2>What is your cancellation policy?</h2>
          <p>Please be aware that Capt. Jack's Tours has a NO CANCELLATION, NO REFUND POLICY. It is no different than if you bought a ticket for a baseball game or a concert….if you miss the event no one is going to send you a refund. All sales are final. If Capt. Jack’s Tours cancels your tour due to weather or any other reason you will receive a full refund.</p>

          <h2>How many people are usually on the tour?</h2>
          <p>This really depends which tour you are doing and what day you are planning for. We use small SUVs that hold 4 people, large SUVs that hold 7 or 8, and passenger vans that hold 11 or 14 guests (you can see our fleet on the About Us page). If you are planning your trip for a Saturday it is likely that you will be in a full vehicle. For any other day of the week it can vary greatly. Just give us a call and we can let you know about a specific date. There is always the option of making the tour private as well.</p>

          <h2>Do you offer custom/private tours?</h2>
          <p>Yes! Private tours can be completely customized to fit your needs. We are very flexible with timing, winery choices, and activity combinations for private tours. We do add in a small fee to make your tour private depending on the tour and the date. Just give us a call and let us know what you have in mind and we will work with you to create the perfect tour.</p>

          <h2>Can a tour start later than the stated time?</h2>
          <p>We are happy to put together a custom tour for you to fit any time constraints you may have. In these cases we will need to make the tour private. Please see our policy above on private tours.</p>
