  "body": "Our sandy beaches, delicious restaurants, and sunny wine valley are waiting for your visit! Santa Barbara is experiencing a beautiful summertime. Come enjoy our free concerts in the park, free movies in the sunken garden courtyard, our farmers and artisan markets, and one of the most diverse wine growing regions in the world! Our wine tours leave everyday and you're just a phone call away from this unique experience. Let us take you kayaking through Santa Barbara's harbor and under Stern's Wharf (built in 1872, it's California's oldest working wood wharf!) where you'll see breathtaking views of the American Riviera. Climb aboard one of our horses and see for yourself why Santa Barbara is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world! Don't let the fires keep you away-they aren't here!"
