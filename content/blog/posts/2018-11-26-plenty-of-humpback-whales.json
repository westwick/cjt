  "body": "The strong wind that blew through the channel the past few days subsided and were back in the water! We had a wonderful trip today. Totals for the trip include 1500 long-beaked common dolphins, 20 Risso’s dolphins, and 5 humpback whales.\r\n\n\r\n\nCaptain and crew initially headed south west to a location that was very productive a few days ago. On the way three different groups of common dolphins located the boat and we had great sightings. A bit further west we encountered a large group of Risso’s dolphins.  It is always fun to see these large animals.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe boat next ran a loop to the east and a little bit to the north where we initially found three whales and then a little later two more joined the fun. The whales were generally moving but in various random directions so no clear migration appeared to be taking place. There were some wonderful tail flukes visible throughout the encounter.\n\nCome out and join us! You never know what you'll see out on the water!"
