It was so clear that you could see “all four corners” of the Santa Barbara Channel (San Miguel to Anacapa, and Bony Ridge to Point Conception).  Wow. Total sightings for the day today included 8+ humpback whales and 400 long-beaked common dolphins.\r\n\n\rThere was a zone of great activity south of The Lanes and near the middle of Santa Cruz Island. Here all of the whales, dolphins, sea lions and various hungry sea birds were feeding on northern anchovies (which are little schooling fish).  They were closely watched as they fed upon schools of northern anchovies that bubbled up from beneath the surface as a pressure wave from an oncoming, open-mouthed whale sent them flying out of the water in a futile attempt to escape their fate.\n\n Among the whales was a group of four that was quite active. They made several friendly, close approaches to the boat and spent quite a bit of time rolling around and otherwise socializing.\n\nJoin the adventure today!"
