  "body": "Gray whales are one of the most commonly-seen whales along the California coast. Their name is taken from the gray patches and white mottling on their dark skin. An adult Pacific Gray Whale can be 45 feet long and weigh up to 33 tons. To help you visualize, that's a little longer than an average school bus and as heavy as a half dozen fully-grown African elephants.\r\n\n\rGray whales migrate 10,000 miles round trip every year, traveling between their winter calving lagoons in Mexico and summer feeding grounds in the Arctic. It's the longest migration of any animal on earth. The 2011 population of California gray whales was thought to number around 28,000, and they all pass the coast as they migrate.\r\n\nFebruary is high traffic season in Santa Barbara. Join us on a whale watching cruise today and experience the beauty of these majestic beings."
