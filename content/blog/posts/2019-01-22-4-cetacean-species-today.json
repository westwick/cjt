  "body": "It was a clear, calm and drop dead gorgeous day today in the Santa Barbara Channel. When we reached Santa Cruz Island it was bright green showing it’s winter and spring coloration. Sightings included 1500 long-beaked common dolphins, 30 Risso’s dolphins, 10 offshore bottlenose dolphins, and one gray whale…making four cetacean species today.\r\n\n\rNear The Lanes we encountered two groups of dolphins. The first group had about 500 animals, and the second about 1000. Great looks were had by all.\r\n\n\r\n\nCaptain and crew next took a run along the sea cliffs of beautiful Santa Cruz Island all the way to the Santa Cruz Channel. As previously mentioned the Island was looking emerald green. Inside the Santa Cruz Channel we located all the rest of the wildlife including the Risso’s, bottlenose, and the whale."
