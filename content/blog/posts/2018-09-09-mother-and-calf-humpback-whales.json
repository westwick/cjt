  "body": "We had some interesting interactions with 1500 short-beaked common dolphins and 2 humpback whales just north of the middle of Santa Rosa Island.  Captain and crew traversed the Santa Barbara Channel with calm seas and morning fog.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe first wildlife stop was to enjoy a megapod of dolphins south of The Lanes near Santa Rosa Island.  This species has a tendency to be more acrobatic and aerial than its longer-beaked cousins.  Many of the animals we saw today were high flyers, and some nice instances of tail-walking were also noted.  Numerous small calves were also in the first pod.  A second, smaller pod located the boat on our way back to Santa Barbara in the afternoon with similar results observed.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe pair of humpback whales was, once again, that same very large adult mother and her calf-of-the-season.  The two were more relaxed today and seemed to spend most of their time hunting.  Nonetheless, we had outstanding looks at this pair again today."
