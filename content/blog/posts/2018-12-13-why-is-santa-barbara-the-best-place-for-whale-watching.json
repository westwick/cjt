  "body": "The Santa Barbara Channel is home to more than 30 species of whales, dolphins, seals, sea otters, sea birds and sea lions that visit throughout the year. It is one of the most consistent locations found anywhere to offer Blue Whale watching, Gray Whale watching, Humpback Whale watching and for Orca, aka Killer Whale watching. Santa Barbara whale watching trips are among the best whale watching trips in Southern California.\r\n\n The “Wonders of Our National Parks” on the Discovery Channel highlighted the outstanding abundance of marine life in the Santa Barbara Channel and named it “One of the 10 Best Places in the World to View Wildlife.” The Channel Islands, on the migration path of the California Gray Whale, offer an opportunity to watch the whales on their way to Baja, where they give birth, and then again as they migrate north with their babies.\r\n\n The height of the Southern California whale watching season is the annual California Gray Whale migration, from December through April. Ocean temperatures are warmer from May through November and feature more blue whales, finback whales and humpback whales, along with killer whales, huge pods of dolphins, seals, sea lions, sea otters and many other marine mammals.\n\nDon't miss out of this delightful adventure!
