  "body": " If you want to see the process of wine-making, now until mid-October is the best time to plan your visit. Wineries will be busy picking their fruit and setting it up for fermentation and, later, bottling.  Most of the picking will be done, either by hand or machine, under the cool cover of the night sky until very early in the morning. This keeps the grapes cool and fresh before they are sorted, pressed, and set for fermentation.\n\n How do we know when a grape has reached the perfect level of ripeness and is ready for harvest? Technology helps, but color, size, and taste will also inform a seasoned grape picker. \n\n All grapes start out green. Around mid-July something called veraison, or the onset of ripening, begins to take hold of the vineyard. Red wine grapes begin to change from green to red or purple and white wine grapes develop a golden or yellow hue. The seeds will also change from green to brown.  Size also changes with veraison. Grapes will change from hard, small berries to large, soft and pliable grapes. Of course, taste is perhaps one of the best ways to ascertain if a grape is ready for picking. Grapes do not continue to ripen once they are off the vine, so making sure they are ripe for the plucking is important!\n\n  At the time of your visit, grape clusters may still be hanging from the vine---perfect for tasting!"
