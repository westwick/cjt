  "body": "Want a great way to see Santa Barbara and taste wine at the same time? We will escort you to 3 wineries here in the city as well as an olive oil and vinegar tasting. Along the way we'll stop and grab a bite to eat at a local restaurant.(Not included in the price.) We include door-to-door transportation from anywhere in Santa Barbara including hotels, rental houses and even the train station!! While this tour doesn't go into the vineyards, it is perfect for groups who are on a tight schedule or who want to be close to downtown to keep the fun going! This tour starts between 10:30 & 11:00 and usually gets done around 5:00.",
