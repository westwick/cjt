  "body": "The \"Wonders of Our National Parks\" on the Discovery Channel highlighted the outstanding abundance of marine life in the Santa Barbara Channel and named it “One of the 10 Best Places in the World to View Wildlife.” The Channel Islands are on the migration path of the California Gray Whale. The islands offer an opportunity to watch the whales on their way to Baja where they give birth, and then again as they migrate north with their babies. More than 30 species of whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea lions frequent the area, including the majestic blue whale, the acrobatic humpback whale, the barnacled gray whale, the powerful orca, the playful long-beaked common dolphin and the gregarious California sea lion. \n\nThis 4 1/2 hour trip takes place on a 75-foot catamaran with beer, wine, soft drinks and snacks available for purchase.",
