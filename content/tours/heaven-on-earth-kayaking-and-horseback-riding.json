This tour combines an ocean kayak tour with a horseback ride. During your morning kayak tour at the beautiful and famous \"smugglers cove\" (Refugio Beach) chances are good that the locals will show up to greet you. Dolphins, sea lions, and the migratory Grey Whale may cruise by (in the distance) to say hello. Next, you'll be transported to a secluded resort nestled between a babbling brook and evergreen sycamore trees where you'll enjoy a delicious lunch (lunch not included in price).\n\nAfter lunch, back into the transport, and off to one of the most breathtaking, scenic guided horseback rides on earth. This ride features spectacular oceans views throughout the ride. Find out why President Ronald Reagan, Michael Jackson, and Brad Pitt, having the ability to live anywhere in the world, chose California’s Central Coast to call their home. Spend the day with Captain Jack, and you too will see why Captain Jack calls this the \"Heaven on Earth\" Tour.\n\n**Tour Includes**: Round-trip transportation, all kayak gear, kayak lesson/brief (kayak knowledge and special athletic ability NOT required), scenic guided horseback ride, no previous riding experience necessary (must be 12 or older), all California Park and Recreation fees, professional, knowledgeable and courteous guides.",

      "description": "We offer door to door transportation from any location in the Santa Barbara area. The day begins between 10:00-10:30 with a scenic drive up the coast to a privately owned rustic ranch. It may look more like a movie set than a ranch but you can rest assured this ranch and the wranglers are the real deal. Your wrangler will guide you on this beautiful horseback ride that winds through the forest and up into the Santa Ynez Mountains where you’ll enjoy spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and the Channel Islands. They’ll tell you stories, some of these stories may even be true! Next you will enjoy lunch at a popular local restaurant (lunch not included in price). Following lunch, we will head to the Santa Rita Hills Wine Trail. Here you will witness some of the most beautiful scenery in the Santa Ynez Valley. We will escort you to two of the region’s top wineries where you’ll enjoy some of California’s finest wines. Captain Jack's will then pour you back into Santa Barbara by 5:30.",
