  "body": "Have you heard that \"great wine is made in the vineyard\", but aren't so sure what that means?  Come sip wine with Santa Barbara Countyâ€™s expert viticulturist, Jeff Newton, in a lovely urban vineyard setting.  Learn more about the grape growing process and how it directly affects your wine.  \r\n\n  \rOnly two miles from downtown Santa Barbara, we will visit a unique backyard property with sixty professionally managed vines. This hour-long experience includes a half-glass taste, a bit of bread/cheese, and a bottle of Syrah to take home.\n\nThis experience can be enjoyed on its own or combined with one of our city tours for a full day of Santa Barbara fun! Please call to make a reservation.",
