  "body": "This 2.5 - 3 hour guided Santa Barbara kayak tour is an extension of our Harbor kayak tour. Our professionally guided tour includes a kayak lesson/briefing, all kayak gear and paddles. The coastal tour offers breathtaking views of Santa Barbara's famous \"Riviera Coast\". Tour starts at the Harbor and paddles south along the coast before turning around and returning to the Harbor. Hopefully the locals, dolphins, sea lion, harbor seals and marine birds will stop by to say hello. Too much fun! We provide snacks, water, towels, and even a plastic bag to store your wet clothes will be provided.",
