  "body": "  Come enjoy Santa Barbara Whale Watching aboard a 50′ Sailing Catamaran. Morning and afternoon trips leaving daily. The Santa Barbara Channel is home to an incredible assortment of marine mammals, including over 30 different species of whales and dolphins. The most common whales sighted on our whale watching adventures are the majestic Pacific Grey Whales, but sometimes we also see the enormous Blue Whales, which can reach up to 100 feet in length and are the largest animals on the planet! On most of our whale watching trips we also see Common, Risso’s and Bottlenose Dolphins, California Sea Lions, Harbor Seals, and lots of other marine life. Occasionally, we are even lucky enough to spot Orcas, Humpback, Minke, and Pilot Whales. Whether you live in Santa Barbara or you’re just visiting, you owe it to yourself and your family to come whale watching. This is a treat we’re sure you’ll remember forever.\n\nAvailable Mid-February (Feb 14) through Mid-May (May 15)",
