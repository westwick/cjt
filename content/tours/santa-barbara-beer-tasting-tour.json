  "body": "On the tour you'll enjoy 3 of the area's prime brewing locations. In Santa Barbara, The Brew House is a lively full service restaurant, and M. Special Brewery up North has bands and food trucks rotating on a regular basis and claims what we believe is the longest bar in SB County made from a single piece of a fallen tree. Carpinteria is home to Island Brewing Company and has been brewing award winning beers in this little slice of paradise since 2000, they have won international acclaim for their hand crafted ales. The Beer Tour includes all tasting fees and transportation. At one of these stops you'll be given time to enjoy lunch. (Lunch not included in the price.) Tours of the beer making process are based on the availability of the brewery staff and the discretion of the guide and may not be possible on busy days.",
