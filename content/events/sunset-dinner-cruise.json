Begin your dinner cruise with your favorite beverage from the bar and conclude with the sun setting as you return to shore. This 50' Catamaran is known for its stability and comfort. Default cruise duration is 2 hours but can be extended to fit your groups needs. We also offer breakfast and lunch cruises. There are a wide variety of delicious menu options to fit any budget. There is an iPod hookup you may want to take advantage of, or we can set you up with a DJ or a live band! Just give us a call or send us an e-mail to go over any of these options.",
