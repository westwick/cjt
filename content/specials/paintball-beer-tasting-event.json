  "body": "This is the perfect Team Building Event. It's also great for Birthday parties, Bachelor & Bachelorette parties or any fun lovin' group of guys & gals.\r\n\nPaintball is a recreational game and an organized sport played year round. The basic game is \"capture the flag,\" where the object of the game is to capture the other team's flag and return it to your team's home base (\"flag station\") for the win, while keeping the other team from capturing your flag! Paintball is enjoyed by people from all walks of life. Anyone can be a star player, as strategy and teamwork, not size, speed or strength, lead to victory.\r\n\nCaptain Jack's Tours will help you create an event worthy of being called “Special”. You can enjoy a wine tasting on the way to the painball course, enjoy a little beer/wine during the event & stop for another beer or wine tasting on the way home. We can provide a box lunch or arrange for lunch at a restaurant or pub. Too Much Fun!",
