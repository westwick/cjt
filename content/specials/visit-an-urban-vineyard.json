  "body": "Have you heard that “great wine is made in the vineyard”, but aren’t so sure what that means? Come sip wine with Santa Barbara County’s expert viticulturist, Jeff Newton, in a lovely urban vineyard setting. Learn more about the grape growing process and how it directly affects your wine.\r\n\n\rOnly two miles from downtown Santa Barbara, we will visit a unique backyard property with sixty professionally managed vines. This hour-long experience includes a half-glass taste, a bit of bread/cheese, and a bottle of Syrah to take home.\r\n\n\rThis experience can be enjoyed on its own or combined with one of our city tours for a full day of Santa Barbara fun! Please call to make a reservation.\r\n\n$45 per person with a minimum of 6 people.",
