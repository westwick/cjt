No sailing experience is necessary, as all Captains are knowledgable sailors who are accustomed to working with all levels of sailing ability from novice to expert. Once on the water, the captain will demonstrate various aspects of racing including taking the helm, sail trim, points of sail and tacking. Challenge old boundaries, build trust and tear down old fears by working together as a well oiled machine. A great choice for team building!",
