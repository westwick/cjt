  "body": "Large group wine tours of the Santa Ynez valley can be customized to fit your groups timing and budget. Take advantage of Captain Jack's knowledge of the area as well as our vendor relationships to put together a great day of wine tasting for your employees, friends, or family. Our variety of vehicles allows us to accommodate groups of any size. We are happy to put together a package that includes lunch and we can even provide transportation to and from the Los Angeles area! We also offer a Sideways tour, visit our tour listings page to see examples of our standard tours. Please keep in mind that larger groups will often increase operating costs as they require extra servers and event staff. If you are interested in the options and pricing for a large group wine tour, please call us to discuss the details.",
