  "body": "This is a great group event for ages 7 and over. No horseback riding experience is neccesary. This is one of the most beautiful trail rides in California. The ride begins just above sea level, criss-crosses through a beautiful forest, and passes a seasonal waterfall before reaching the top of a nearby mountain where you will enjoy scenic ocean views. This is a great stop for pictures! The ride lasts 1.5 hours and we can accommodate two groups of 40 back to back for a maximum of 80 people. Start times are flexible for large groups, please call us to discuss the details.",
