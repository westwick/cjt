With over 100 wineries in the scenic Santa Ynez Valley, the year-round near perfect climate and light prevailing winds in the Central Coast of California makes this an ideal place for ballooning. FAA Commercial Certified Pilots offer a once in a lifetime experience you will never forget! On an average day you may catch a glimpse of “Neverland Ranch” while floating over wine vineyards and rolling hills. We offer 45 minutes to 1 hour duration flights that capture views over the Beautiful Wine Country surrounded by Transverse Mountain Ranges, the Channel Islands, Lake Cachuma and the historic towns of Solvang, Los Olivos, Buellton, Santa Maria and Paso Robles.
