You can also private charter a 65' deep-sea fishing boat for full or half day fishing trips. Rod, bait, tackle, and fishing licenses can all be provided, and staff is on hand to help you \"catch on\" and clean your fish! This is a very popular trip especially in the summer months, so if you are interested please book early.",
