Or, hike Trespass Trail and take in the beautiful views of the Pacific and the Channel Islands, followed by a soak in the natural hot spring. These tours can be combined in any way to fit your group interests and schedule. See our [Heaven on Earth tour](/tours/heaven-on-earth-kayaking-and-horseback-riding) for an example of our full day combination tour. You can also combine any of these activities with many of our other tours such as wine or beer tasting, paint ball, paragliding, or even finish the day with a relaxing sunset sailing cruise!",
