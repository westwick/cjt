  "body": "Santa Barbara's world class paragliding hill offers one day lessons for participants 11 years old and up with no prior experience necessary. Participants will practice ground control by jogging with the paraglider over head getting a feel for the steering controls. After a few practice runs its time to take your first flight under radio supervision. Most participants are simply amazed they are able to launch, fly, and land the world's most evolutionary aircraft many times on their very first day. We encourage you to organize a family outing, bachelor party, team building event, or birthday party for what has to be one of the most unique adventures on the planet.",
