Captain Jackâ€™s Tours offers a one and a half hour harbor kayak tour (also available as a sunset tour). We use extra wide oversized kayaks to ensure the most comfortable and safe ride possible. All tours include life vests, paddles and a kayak orientation / lesson. This tour is great for kids and adults alike, and no kayaking experience is necessary. We can accommodate 30 people at a time or two groups of 20 back to back for a maximum of 40 people. Start times are flexible for large groups, please call us to discuss the details.",
