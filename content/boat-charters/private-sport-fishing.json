Go Sportfishing, whale watching, explore the Channel Islands, see our coastline or simply celebrate a special adventure with your family and friends. Our private charters are designed with your enjoyment, comfort and safety in mind. With room for your private group up to 6 passengers.\r\n\nThis custom 41 foot Radon Sportfisher with a flying bridge and integrated swim step was locally built in Santa Barbara.

The restroom/shower is enclosed outside of the cabin for comfort and privacy and has hot and cold running fresh water. She is powered by new twin 435 horsepower Volvo diesel engines. A 12.5kwatt generator provides 110 and 220 power throughout the boat which means you can use and charge your electrical devices and has a 400 mile range with a cruising speed of up to 20 knots.",
