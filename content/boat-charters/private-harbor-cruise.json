  "title": "Private Harbor Cruise",
  "body": "The roomiest little boat in the harbor. Enjoy a relaxing cruise on this ‘Duffy’ style electric yacht. She holds 12 people comfortably but due to local coast guard guidelines, the maximum capacity for this boat is 6 guests. She is perfect for small intimate dinners, cocktail, brunch and wildlife cruises.\r\n\nAnother great feature on this boat is the ability to bring your own beer and wine without paying any corkage fees. You may also bring your own food or we can provide it for you (at an additional charge).\r\n\nIncludes a US Coast Guard certified Captain so all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the beautiful scenery in Santa Barbara’s harbor.",
  "extra": "$250 for 1 ½ hour Harbor Cruise. Plus 12% Port Tax and 18% Gratuity",
