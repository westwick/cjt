  "body": "What could be more romantic than a wedding and reception at sea? How about an anniversary or retirement party aboard a 50-foot yacht? Whatâ€™s more fun than a birthday, graduation, bachelor or prom party as you cruise the Santa Barbara Coastline? Whatever the occasion, Captain Jack will provide an unforgettable experience to complement your special moments.\n\nThe fifty foot length and catamaran design make this sailboat both roomy and very stable for all. Cruises can be as short as a 2 hour-long cocktail cruise or as long as a fully catered all-day marine life safari to Santa Cruz Island. No host bar on board with snacks for your enjoyment.",
