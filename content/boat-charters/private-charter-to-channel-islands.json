  "body": "Set sail to the Channel Islands aboard a French luxury yacht with a private captain and up to 6 people in your party. Try your hand at navigation and steering the yacht or just sit back and enjoy the sunshine.  We depart at approximately 10am from Ventura. It takes 2-3 hours to sail to Anacapa Island where we will drop the hook. Once we anchor at the island you can kayak and snorkel (gear provided) or enjoy the drinks you brought along while we prepare lunch. You'll hear plenty of stories about Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands as you sail along the American Riviera.",
